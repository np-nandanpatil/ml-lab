### Hello there!
I made this repo to make it easier for myself - for revision purposes, it makes easier for me to open up this repo and just glance at the programs and <strong>YAY!</strong> I am ready to give exam.  
I made it public for my friends to do the same, use this repo to study, I will be constantly updating the SimplifiedLabPrograms.ipynb whenever I find some ways to cut down the number of lines!!

<strong><big>Happy learning!</big><strong>
